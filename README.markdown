# Screenshot Detector

A simple app that shows how to discover screenshots by leaving a persistent `NSMetadataQuery` running.  It can be used to find all existing screenshots, or when a user takes a new screenshot.  It relies on a certain spotlight attribute (`kMDItemIsScreenCapture`) that gets set on screenshot files.

It also uses bindings. Profusely.

The universe will implode now.
